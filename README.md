# Bird Species Classification

### Understanding Data
This project is focused on classifying images of birds into one of 200 species in the given dataset. Since this is a multi-class classification problem, a critical first step is to examine whether the dataset suffers from class imbalance. A significant imbalance could bias the model toward over-represented classes. The summary statistics shown below indicate that data is well balanced across classes.
```bash
Summary of class distribution:
Min samples in a class:   29  
Max samples in a class:   30  
Mean samples per class:   29.97  
Std deviation:            0.17101529509309654
```
Despite being balanced, the dataset presents a high level of complexity due to its limited number of samples per class (~30) combined with a large number of classes (200 bird species). This low-data, high-class-count scenario makes the classification task challenging, as the model must learn fine-grained visual distinctions with very few examples per category.

### Creating Validation Set
Since the ground truth labels for the test dataset are not provided, the original training data was split (90% training, 10% validation) into training and validation sets. A stratified split was used to ensure that each class was proportionally represented in both sets.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
A custom Dataset class was implemented to handle image loading and preprocessing. As part of the preprocessing pipeline
- Images were resized to 224Ã—224 pixels.
- A random horizontal flip was applied with a probability of 0.5 to introduce basic data augmentation.
- Images were then converted to PyTorch tensors and normalized.
